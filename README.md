# SmartHome-Gesture-Control-Classification (Part 2)
Part 1: Develop a mobile application to control SmartHome devices through gestures, offering convenience and accessibility. Part 2: Develop a Python application for classifying SmartHome gestures. Tools: TensorFlow, Python, OpenCV, Keras.

Part 1: SmartHome Gesture Control Application

Objective: Develop a mobile application to control SmartHome devices through gestures, offering convenience and accessibility.
Tools: Android Studio, MatLab or Python, YouTube for video submission.
Three screens with specific functionalities: displaying gesture videos, enabling video replay, capturing user practice videos, and uploading them to a local server.
Videos should focus solely on gestures without showing the user's face or surroundings.
Submission includes source code, recorded videos, and a demo video for peer review.

Part 2: SmartHome Gesture Classification

Objective: Develop a Python application for classifying SmartHome gestures.
Tools: TensorFlow, Python, OpenCV, Keras.
Tasks include generating penultimate layers for training and test videos, recognizing gestures using cosine similarity, and saving results to "results.csv."
Submission includes the Python application, training gesture videos, README, results, and a report evaluating the application.

Both parts aim to enhance SmartHome control through gestures and provide hands-on experience in mobile computing and machine learning. Part 1 focuses on application development, while Part 2 delves into gesture classification using machine learning techniques.
